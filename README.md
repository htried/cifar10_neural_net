# cifar10_neural_net

This repository is a collection of several neural networks (based on the "All Convolutional Net" put forth by Springenberg et al, 2015) that achieved 86% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image database. This code is implemented in Keras. We were participating in a datathon when this code was written, so there was a separate test set used for grading and kept apart from the normal CIFAR-10 dataset - however, we achieved even higher results using the normal Keras importation of CIFAR-10.
